It is intended to develop this specification under the umbrella of a suitable standards organization. Until then contributions are most welcome but **each contributor** (the person and the organization that is represented by that person) **is required to**:
1. **declare any** patents, patent applications, copyrights, or other **intellectual property rights** that might require a party to obtain one or more licenses in order to implement, use, or commercialize, the specification
2. **offer perpetual royalty free licenses** to intellectual property rights on any contributions that are included in approved versions of this specification

See the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20170801/#def-RF) for an example of the kind of licensing requirements that are intended for this work. 
Also at least glance over the IETF Best Current Practices on this topic: [BCP79](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp79) and [BCP78](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp78).
